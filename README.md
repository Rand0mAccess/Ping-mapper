# Ping-mapper
I know it's look a sinple nmap but a better version is in  building phase, i awalys think to be more efficent that's why m creating it in upcoming updates it will include :

1. Automatic Ping feature by which it can check by itself the host is active or not.
2. Automatically scan the whole network in the backgroung and check for open ports.

These update will be soon onboard if you wanna contribute do ping me on https://discord.gg/BM7SnRa9fQ
